I used ChatGPT for this lab because i was confused where i have to create Test Players so i asked to ChatGPT and Here is my Conversation.


Heyy ChatGPT , i'm confused where i have to create file for Test Player in this Lab5 ?

ChatGPT said:
Hey! You should create your test files inside the src/test/java/lab5/players directory. This is the conventional location for unit tests in a Java project. If this directory doesn't exist, you can create it.

Your test class should be named something like LinusTest.java or OmolaTest.java depending on which player you're testing. You'll use JUnit to write and run your tests.

Let me know if you need help setting up the test class! ðŸš€
